<TEXT> Topic Modeling is a common and popular method to explore textual datasets. In particular, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (or LDA) algorithm has been incredibly popular over the years. By no means is it perfect, but it works well enough on most datasets that it's taken over, and many extensions of it exist. JSAT currently has a implementation of this algorithm that was meant for processing larger collections. However this example will just demonstrate how to use it and extract some topics from a model.
