# DHProject

This project originated in the course of the seminar "Introduction to digital humanities"
by Thomas Koentges at the University of Leipzig.
In the course we examined the concept of marriage in German parliamentary debates.

In every class there is a specific READ.ME in german.

The CountSpeaches class counts all speeches of each party per debate.
The CleanDok class extracts each party's speeches from each debate.
The SortByParty class sortes the speeches by parties.
The WordFrequency class counts the word frequencys of each debate.
